# AdventOfCode2022

Hi! You are welcome to have a look at my solutions of Advent of Code 2022.

The Quest starts here: https://adventofcode.com/

Highlight and take-offs from the puzzles:

Day  1  sorted and reversed list<br>
Day  2  look-up dictionary for combinations of input<br>
Day  3  data preprocessing while reading input file, sets operation<br>
Day  4  data preprocessing while reading input file, sets operation<br>
Day  5  regular expression (findall) while reading input file, stack handling<br>
Day  6  marker (n distinct chars) in a stream <br>
Day  7  multiple branch tree structure, recursion<br>
Day  8  grid analysis by slicing, transposing 2D list<br>
Day  9  chain of knots with dependent movement in grid. os module to get own filename<br>
Day  10  loop reading commands and operation cycle running asynchronous<br>
Day  11  distribution of modified items in a group. modulo of all_divisors limit numbers form getting too big. (not understood why)<br>
Day  12  depth fist search (dfs) does not work or is too slow. How to know from the task that here is breadth first search (bfs) needed?<br>
Day  13  convert string representation of lists and ints to "real" objects (json). Using customized comparator for sorting (e.g bubblesort)<br>
Day  14  convert string representation of tuple to "real" object by eval(). Enlarge grid dynamically<br>
Day 15 manhattan distance. handling intervals (lo, hi) instead of all points. merge intervals.<br>
Day 16 <br>
Day 17 collision check by sets. use while-loops to jump over huge range of counter. find repeated states in look-up dict.<br>
Day 18 touching sides of 3D cube grid as +/- .5 off grid nodes. Breadth first search for floodfill from outside<br>
Day 19 cut states of bfs by heuristic value but need to find the minimum number states to keep<br>
Day 20 move only indices as reference to numbers, not the numbers themselves. %-modulo operator to wrap around (jump from end to end of list)<br>
Day 21 use "eval" to call strings as functions. use sympy to solve equation formally (works for complicated structure and very high numbers)<br>
Day 22 jump from one edge of map to another on 2D and on 3D cube of this map (only hard coding, no algorithm?)<br>
Day 23 distribution on grid until steady state. synchronous move of all elements, not one after the other<br>
Day 24 bfs with changing obstacles and targets.<br>
Day 25 convert number to base 5 and back with offset of digit into negative<br>
