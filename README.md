# AdventOfCode2022

Hi! You are welcome to have a look at my solutions of Advent of Code 2022.

The Quest starts here: https://adventofcode.com/

Highlight and take-offs from the puzzles:

Day  1  sorted and reversed list<br>
Day  2  look-up dictionary for combinations of input<br>
Day  3  data preprocessing while reading input file, sets opearation<br>
Day  4  data preprocessing while reading input file, sets opearation<br>
Day  5  regular expression (findall) while reading input file, stack handling<br>
Day  6  marker (n distinct chars) in a stream <br>
Day  7  multiple branch tree structure, recursion<br>
Day  8  grid analysis by slicing, transposing 2D list<br>
Day  9  chain of knots with depending movement in grid. os mudule to get own filename<br>
Day  10  loop reading commands and operation cycle running asynchronic<br>
Day  11  distribution of modified items in a group. modulo of all_divisors limit numbers form getting too big. (not understood why)<br>
Day  12  depth fist search (dfs) does not work or is too slow. How to know from the task that here is breadth first search (bfs) needed?<br>
Day  13  convert sting reprsentation of lists and ints to "real" objects (json). Using customized comparator for sorting (e.g bubblesort)<br>
